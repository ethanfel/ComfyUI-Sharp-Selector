# 🔪 ComfyUI Sharp Frame Selector

A suite of custom nodes for [ComfyUI](https://github.com/comfyanonymous/ComfyUI) designed to intelligently extract the sharpest frames from video footage. 

Based on the [sharp-frames](https://github.com/Reflct/sharp-frames-python) logic, this tool uses **Laplacian Variance** to score image clarity. It is optimized for high-resolution video processing using a **Sidechain Workflow** that saves massive amounts of RAM.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Sidechain Optimization:** Analyze lightweight 512px proxy images to control the selection of heavy 4K raw frames.
* **Batched Extraction:** Splits video into time slots (e.g., 1 second) and picks the single best frame from each slot. Perfect for ensuring action scenes are not missed.
* **Threshold Filtering:** Automatically discards frames that are too blurry, even if they are the "winner" of their batch.
* **Buffer Control:** Optional dead-zones between batches to reduce frame count or ensure temporal separation.
